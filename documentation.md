## Commenting Out Code

- **Single-line comment:** `//`
- **Multi-line comment:** `/* */`

## Variables

Variables are used to store data. There are three ways to declare a variable:

- **let:** Block-scoped variable.
- **const:** Constant variable, its value cannot be changed once assigned.
- **var:** Function-scoped variable.

## Accessing Individual Characters in a String Variable

In JavaScript, individual characters in a string variable can be accessed using bracket notation.

## Arrays

Arrays allow storing multiple values, which can be of different data types.

## Functions

Functions are blocks of reusable code that can be invoked as needed.

## Scope and Functions

Scope defines the visibility of variables.

- Global Scope: Variables can be accessed throughout the JavaScript code.
- Local Scope: Variables are only accessible within a specific portion of the code.

## Conditionals

Conditional statements are used to execute different actions based on different conditions.

## JavaScript Objects

JavaScript objects are used to store data using key-value pairs.

## Loops

Loops are used to iterate through data until a certain condition is met.

## Tertiary Operator

The ternary operator provides a shorthand for if-else statements.

## JavaScript Methods

- `.length`: Returns the length of data.
- `.hasOwnProperty()`: Checks if an object has a property.
- `Object.freeze()`: Freezes an object to prevent mutation.
- `.concat()`: Concatenates arrays.

## JavaScript Functions

- `.push()`: Adds a value to an array.
- `.pop()`: Removes and returns the last value in an array.
- `.includes()`: Checks if a value is in an array.
- `.shift()`: Removes the first element in an array.
- `.unshift()`: Adds an element to the beginning of an array.
- `.reduce()`: Reduces an array using a callback function.

## JavaScript Operators

- Rest operator: `...variable` - Converts arguments into an array.
- Spread operator: `[...variable]` - Expands elements of an array.

## String Interpolation

String interpolation allows combining strings and variables together using backticks (\`).
