// VARIABLES
/* 
You store data using a variable.

There are 3 ways to declare a variable - let, const, var.

You can assign data to variables. The let variable is a scope level variable 
(specified in a block, can only be used in that block)

e.g let name; // UNASSIGNED VARIABLE
let name = "name"; // ASSIGNED VARIABLES

The const variable is mainly used for assignment variables that won't or 
should'nt be changed.
e.g const pi; // UNASSIGNED VARIABLE
const pi = 3.14; // ASSIGNED VARIABLES

The var variable works just like the let variable but is a global scope variable
(specified in a block, can be used outside the block.)
e.g var school; // UNASSIGNED VARIABLE 
var school = "school"; // ASSIGNED VARIABLES
