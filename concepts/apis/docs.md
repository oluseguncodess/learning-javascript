# Learning about Apis

## What are interfaces?

- Theses are hardware or software that help us do specific things. They abstract the core complex way of doing task -- i know what it does, i just don't know how it does it (in the words of the instructors)

e.g a play button for example is used to play a song, a user on spotify doesn't have to write the code to do that, that programmer does the writing of the code, the user just has to click the button(how i understand it lol)

- Interfaces abstracts implementation

## What are api's?
Application programming interfaces define how interfaces are expected to be used and what you can expect to receive when using interfaces without bothering about how they work -- this is the power of abstraction, helps prevent always reinventing the wheel ðŸŽ¡

## What are remote api's
These are api's that aren't running directly on your devices but on the internet. They have massive computational power and are quite fast. E.g singing into google song search microphone to well, search for a song. example is the popular REST api.
